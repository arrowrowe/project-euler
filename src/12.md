# 12. Highly divisible triangular number

> The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

> 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

> Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

> ```
 1: 1
 3: 1,3
 6: 1,2,3,6
10: 1,2,5,10
15: 1,3,5,15
21: 1,3,7,21
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

Module[{
  DivisorCount = Length@Divisors@# &,
  ForWhile = Module[{i = #1, v = #2@#1}, For[, #3@v, i++; v = #2@i]; v] &
